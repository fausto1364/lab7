We used the suggested platform (https://swish.swi-prolog.org) for programming. The query can be entered in the form suggested on the exercise sheet, e.g.

?- add_date("2205", 14)   % add 14 days from 22nd of May
?- sub_date("2205", 10)   % subtract 10 days from 22nd of May

which will return answers in this format:

‚0506‘
‚1205‘
